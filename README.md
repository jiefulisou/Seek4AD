Seek4AD, a multi-modal anomaly task assistant which search the knowledge base under a certain domain through ADSeeker. The Seek-Agent RAG framework of ADSeeker is tailored for seeking knowledge across the first anomaly detection knowledge
base, ADSeek-I&M. 

## 🔍 Model Architecture

</p>
The architecture of Seek4AD. It consists of two main knowledge-infused pathways:(1) the query image is fed to the Seek-Agent and the mapping features extracted from linear layers are fed into ADSeeker to compute the similarity with visual embeddings of ADSeek to retrieve high-relevant domain knowledge.(2) The AD Expert integrates defect-region information involved in HSP and type-level features in learnable textual prompts as semantic-rich visual tokens which will be passed into LLM.
